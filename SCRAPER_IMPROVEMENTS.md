## 🚨 Error Handling

If scraping fails, you'll get helpful feedback:
- "No items found during scraping. The website structure may be unusual or protected."
- "Failed to fetch base URL: [URL]"
- "AI failed to organize the scraped data"

The scraper will still process whatever it can and skip problematic items.

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with 1-2 pages** to test a new website
2. **Use specific category URLs** for better targeting
3. **Avoid protected sites** (those requiring login/captcha)
4. **Max 10 pages** per command (to save resources)
5. **Wait between commands** (rate limiting protects servers)
